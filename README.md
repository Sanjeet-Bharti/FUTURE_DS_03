✅ Cleaned and prepared raw CSV feedback data using Pandas

✅ Analyzed ratings (1–10 scale) to uncover patterns in student satisfaction

✅ Simulated and processed text comments using NLP (TextBlob) to classify sentiment

✅ Visualized trends using Matplotlib and Seaborn

✅ Suggested data-backed improvements for event organizers
